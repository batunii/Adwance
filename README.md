# Adwance
A Fork of Adwaita Gnome Shell Theme with some changes to make it look modern.
I have extracted the official Gnome-Shell.css from the gnome-shell-theme.gresources file found in /usr/share/gnome-shell using the 'gresource extract' command. I then edited few line of CSS file and repackaged it as a new shell theme and then apllied it.
The changes I made are :
1. Reduce the size of top panel to : 1.7e
2. Made Search bar translucent.
3. Made Dash translucent.
4. Made App Folder translucent.
5. Removed the gray background from the overview and replaced with image of my choice.

You can play along with other things too if you want!
!! But be careful !!

I have put the Shell-Theme and some accompanying wallpapers with their blurred and darkened counter parts for the maximum effect!
